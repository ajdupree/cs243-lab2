		This is where things get trickier. I don't see a definition for runPass which

		within the classes? Then how do we transform these into control flow graphs?

		While I'm sure the last code paragraph would correctly apply our 
		RedundantNullCheck analysis on each method in each class, we will need to 
		access the interior cfgs in order to modify them in the next step.
	
		End result we need is analysis.getExit(), for each method/cfg analyzed. Then 
		we'll iterate over those cfgs and remove the indicated quads.
